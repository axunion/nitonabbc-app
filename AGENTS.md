# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents (Claude Code and others) when working with this repository.

## Project Overview

PWA for members (~30) of Nitonabbc Church. Solid.js + TypeScript, Vite build, pnpm.

- LINE authentication only, 2 roles (admin / member)
- Light theme + frost-white glassmorphism ("God's Glory" theme), mobile-first
- Japanese/English i18n
- External subdomain services embedded via iframe

## Approach

Bias toward caution over speed; on trivial tasks, use judgment.

- **Think before coding.** State assumptions. Make routine judgment calls yourself and
  note them; ask only when different interpretations would lead to materially different
  work. If a simpler path exists, say so and push back when warranted.
- **Simplest thing that works.** Write the minimum code that solves the stated problem —
  nothing speculative. No unasked-for abstractions, flexibility, or error handling for
  impossible cases. If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it.
- **Surgical changes.** Every changed line should trace to the request. Don't refactor,
  reformat, or "improve" adjacent code that isn't broken; match the surrounding style.
  Remove only the imports and symbols your change orphaned; leave unrelated dead code alone
  and mention it.
- **Goal-driven.** Turn each task into a verifiable outcome ("fix the bug" → "write a
  failing test that reproduces it, then make it pass"). For multi-step work, state a brief
  plan before starting.

## Language

Write all durable artifacts in **English** — in-code comments, console output, error and
log messages, AI-readable instruction files, and docs meant for readers (README and the
like).

Everything else follows the user's language: chat replies, and any document that only
exists during development (scratch notes, planning notes, temporary docs not meant to
ship).

## Specification Documents

Specs live in `docs/`. Always read the relevant doc before implementing.
Add a new doc in `docs/` and link it from `spec.md` when adding features.

@docs/spec.md

## Safety: Deployment and Production Data

Production deployments and remote DB migrations run exclusively via GitHub Actions.
The npm scripts `deploy` and `db:migrate:remote` are **intentionally not defined** in
`package.json` to prevent accidental local execution.

**Never run the following from a local machine:**

- `wrangler deploy` — production deployments are triggered by push to `main` (or any branch for Preview)
- `wrangler d1 migrations apply ... --remote` — production DB migrations run via GitHub Actions only
- Any other `wrangler` command targeting production with `--remote`

**Allowed locally:**

- `pnpm db:migrate:local` — apply pending migrations to local D1
- `pnpm db:reset` — wipe local D1 and re-apply all migrations from scratch
- `pnpm db:seed` — insert sample data from `scripts/seed.sql`
- `pnpm db:fresh` — `db:reset` + `db:seed` in one step
- All other local dev operations: `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm check`, `pnpm test`, etc.

## Architecture

- **Routing**: `@solidjs/router`. Routes defined in `src/index.tsx`, root layout in `src/App.tsx` (auth gate + Toaster)
  - Member routes (`/`, `/settings`, `/bulletin/*`) nest under `MemberLayout` (TabBar)
  - Admin routes (`/admin/*`) nest under `AdminLayout` (sidebar, admin role guard)
  - TabBar behavior (mobile vs desktop, per-tab state restoration): see `docs/spec.md`
- **Auth context**: `useAuth()` from `src/store/AuthContext.tsx` — provides user info and `logout`

See `.claude/rules/` for detailed conventions per area (UI, CSS, API, testing).

## Directory Structure

- `src/components/<Name>/` — component, CSS module, and `index.ts` re-export
- `src/pages/<Name>/` — page component (route-level screen), with `hooks/` for complex logic
- `src/api/<resource>.ts` — API fetch functions (pages do not write fetch logic inline)
- `src/store/` — Solid.js stores (`createResource`-based)
- `src/styles/` — global styles (`tokens.css`, `reset.css`, `shared.module.css`)
- `server/routes/` — Hono API routes (one file per resource)
- `server/middleware/` — shared middleware
- `server/db/schema.ts` — Drizzle schema (single source of truth)
- `server/db/types.ts` — shared bulletin section types
- `server/db/index.ts` — `createDb()` and `Db` type
- `server/types.ts` — `AppEnv`, `User`, `SessionData`, and other server-wide types
- `worker/index.ts` — Worker entry point (re-exports the Hono app)
- `drizzle/` — drizzle-kit generated migration SQL (committed)

## Environments

| Env | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Local | `pnpm dev` starts Vite (HMR) + workerd together via `@cloudflare/vite-plugin`. Set `DEV_AUTH=true` in `.dev.vars` to skip LINE auth and auto-login as admin |
| Preview | Auto-deployed on non-`main` branch push |
| Production | Auto-deployed on `main` branch push |

KV / D1 bindings are isolated per environment. LINE Login callback URLs must be configured per environment.

## Database (Cloudflare D1 + Drizzle)

See `.claude/rules/api.md` for schema, access, and migration-command conventions (loads automatically when editing `server/`, `worker/`, or `drizzle/`). Use the `/db-migrate` skill for the guided schema-change workflow.

## Code Structure

- Name variables, functions, and files to communicate intent.
- One concern per file; split new code when a file exceeds ~300 lines. Don't split
  existing files unless asked.
- Extract a helper only when used in 3+ places; otherwise inline it.
- Delete dead code you create; never comment it out.

## Testing

- Write tests before or alongside implementation — they are your success criteria.
- If the project has no test setup, ask briefly: introduce one, or verify another way?
- Test observable outcomes and edge cases, not implementation details.
- Each test is fully self-contained; no shared mutable state between tests.

## Commits

Format — plain prose, no prefixes or labels (`feat:`, `fix:`, and the like):

```
<summary: imperative mood, ≤70 chars, no trailing period>

<motivation: one sentence, only when not evident from the diff>

- <change bullets: only for 2+ distinct changes>
```

- Never commit secrets (`*.key`, `*.pem`, `credentials*`).
- Never use `--no-verify`. Use `--amend` only when explicitly asked; default to a new
  commit.
